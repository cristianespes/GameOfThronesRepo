He rushes to Castle Winterfell, which is ruled by Eddard 'Ned' Stark, Warden of the North, who decapitates the soldier for deserting his post. In King's Landing, the capital, Jon Arryn, the 'Hand of the King', dies under mysterious circumstances. King Robert Baratheon, Ned's longtime friend, travels to Winterfell, offering the position to him and also proposing marriage between his firstborn son Joffrey and Ned's older daughter Sansa. Ned's wife Catelyn receives a letter from her sister Lysa, Jon Arryn's widow, saying that she has escaped King's Landing and that Jon was murdered by the Lannisters, Queen Cersei's family. Catelyn burns the letter and tells Ned about it, believing that the Lannisters are plotting against Robert. Ned's 10-year-old son, Brandon, climbs a tower, where he witnesses Cersei having sex with her twin brother, Jaime, who then pushes him out the window from a presumably fatal height.

Jon Snow, Ned's illegitimate son, heads north to join the brotherhood of the Night's Watch, protectors of the Wall that keeps the White Walkers and the wildlings from entering civilized Westeros. Tyrion, Cersei's brother, decides to forgo the trip south with his family and instead accompanies Snow's entourage to the Wall.
